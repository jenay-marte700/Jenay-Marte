    <h2>Reflection 1</h2>
       <p> 
I enjoy photographing landscapes or architecture that stands out to me when I’m out walking. Certain patterns or old structures will make me stop and take pictures of it. Taking photos helps me pay closer attention to my surroundings and notice details that I normally wouldn’t see if I were to just walk past it without much thought. I also enjoy photographing moments with my family. Since the majority of my extended family lives outside of the country and I don't see them often, I like taking photos of the moments we share together so I can look back on them in the future. Photography is a way of creating a personal record of my life, something I can revisit to remember how I saw and experienced the world at a particular moment. 

I think photography and illustration can capture both the challenges and the beauty/art of our time. For example, photographs of architecture could show the contrast between old and new buildings, reflecting how society is constantly changing but still tied to its past. It can also show the contrasts between modern architecture and older architecture in buildings which is very common in neighborhoods in New York City. Landscapes could highlight how we interact with the environment, whether through nature that feels untouched or through spaces altered by human activity. Adding text to an image could make ideas even clearer, either by guiding the viewer’s interpretation or by creating a contrast between what is seen and what is read.
